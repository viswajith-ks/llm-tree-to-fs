## Original Python CLI

Run the script locally to generate files in the current directory.

**Usage:**

```bash
python python-cli/main.py [structure_file]
```

If no file is specified, it defaults to looking for `structure.md`.

### Example

**Input (structure.md):**

```plaintext
my-project/
    ├── src/
    │   ├── components/
    │   │   └── Header.jsx
    │   └── utils/
    └── README.md
```

**Command:**

```bash
python python-cli/main.py structure.md
```

### Disclaimer

- Filenames with special characters to be handled carefully.
- The Python CLI assumes your filenames do not contain whitespaces. The Web version and the extension handles whitespaces correctly.
