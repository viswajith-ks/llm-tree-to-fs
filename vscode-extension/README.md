# AI Tree Scaffolder

**Stop creating folders manually.** AI Tree Scaffolder instantly turns ASCII directory trees (generated by ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude...) into actual folders and files in your VS Code workspace.

## 🚀 Features

* **AI Ready:** Perfect for pasting project structures suggested by LLMs.
* **Smart Parsing:** Handles standard tree characters (`├──`, `└──`) and simple indentation.
* **Zero Config:** Works right out of the box.
* **Context Aware:** Generates files relative to your workspace root or the folder you select.

## 📖 Usage

1. **Paste** your ASCII tree structure into any file in VS Code.
2. **Highlight** the tree structure text.
3. **Right-click** the selection.
4. Select **Generate Files from Tree**.

## 💡 Example Input

Simply highlight text that looks like this:

```text
my-new-app/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Header.tsx
│   │   └── Footer.tsx
│   └── utils/
│       └── api.ts
├── public/
│   └── index.html
